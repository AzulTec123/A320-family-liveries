Livery guidelines. Please do try and follow these, to ensure they can be added to this repository. Thank you!

1. Liveries will be stored in this repository. A small number of liveries will be selected to be included with the aircraft.
2. All liveries should be as accurate as possible, within reason, particularly in terms of logos and colours.
3. All liveries must have historically or currently been used on the A320. No fictional liveries will be accepted to the main livery repository. Virtual Airline liveries are one exception, and may be stored in a dedicated part of the repository.
4. The livery must be associated with the correct engine variant and options (wifi antenna, sharklets and so on) of the real aircraft.
5. We will only have one example of each distinct livery of an airline for each different model. Liveries with only small distinctions such as registration number or options will not be accepted. One example of each historical livery will be accepted. 
6. Each livery must be created in 4096*4096 resolution. Lower and higher resolution versions may be accepted in addition to the 4K variant.
7. The livery should be of reasonable quality, particularly, the livery should match up at UV boundaries with no mismatching.
8. The description should be in this format: ICAO Airline Name (Extra Info).
9. Liveries will be reviewed before being added.

Feel free to submit liveries by direct contact on the forums, Discord, or by pull request from a fork of this repository.
